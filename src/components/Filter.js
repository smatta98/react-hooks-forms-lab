// Once you've determined which component should hold the state for this feature, set up your initial state, and connect that state to the input field. 
// Remember, we're trying to make this input a controlled input â€” so the input's value should always be in sync with state.

// After you've connected the input to state, you'll also need to find a way to set state when the input changes. 
// To get the test passing, you'll need to use a prop called onSearchChange as a callback.
